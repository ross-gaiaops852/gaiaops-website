# GaiaOps Website Development Project Brief - Updated

## Project Overview
GaiaOps is a specialized digital operations agency focused on transforming environmental consultancies (5-25 employees) from operational chaos to systematic excellence. Using a subscription-based model, we implement proven **Operational Tracks** that guide firms through progressive levels of capability maturation while building toward sustainable business growth through our flywheel model.

## Business Model Evolution

### Core Value Proposition (Updated)
Environmental consultancies are crucial to addressing sustainability challenges but often struggle with operational inefficiencies that limit their impact. GaiaOps transforms these firms through our **Progressive Operational Excellence** framework, advancing them systematically across six core operational tracks from basic efficiency to strategic market advantage.

### Tracks-Based Service Delivery
