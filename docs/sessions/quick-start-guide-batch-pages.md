## üöÄ Starting the Claude Code Session

### Step 1: Feed Claude Code the Context

**In Claude Code, send this message first**:

```
Hi! I need you to help me build three pages for the GaiaOps website: Pricing, About, and Contact pages. 

Before we start coding, please read these essential files:

1. docs/sessions/session-plan-pricing-about-contact-batch.md (the complete session plan)
2. docs/core/gaiaops-development-config-v3.md (development configuration)
3. docs/reference/complete-list-available-heroicons.md (verified icons only)

After reading these, confirm you understand:
- The three pages we're building
- Brand colors (Ocean Teal #2A7F7E, Systematic Blue #1B365D, Impact Orange #D97642)
- 60/30/10 color distribution rule
- That we test after EVERY section
- Verified icons only (from the list)
- Proper Calendly URLs with UTM parameters

Ready to start with the Pricing Page?
```

### Step 2: Build in Order

**Recommended Order**:
1. Pricing Page (establishes patterns)
2. About Page (narrative flow)
3. Contact Page (simplest)

**Or if you prefer parallel**:
- Can work on pages simultaneously if comfortable with git branching
- But sequential is safer for first time

### Step 3: Test After Every Section

**Critical**: Don't move to the next section until current one works!

```powershell
# After each section:
1. Save file in VS Code
2. Check browser (hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check console for errors (F12)
4. Test on mobile width (responsive toggle in DevTools)
5. If good, move to next section
6. If issues, fix before proceeding
```

## üé® Critical Brand Requirements

### Colors (Copy-Paste These Exact Hex Codes)
```css
/* Primary */
--ocean-teal: #2A7F7E;      /* 60% of page */
--systematic-blue: #1B365D;  /* 30% of page */
--impact-orange: #D97642;    /* 10% of page */

/* Supporting */
--success-green: #48BB78;
--light-gray: #E2E8F0;
--dark-gray: #2D3748;
```

### Typography
- **Inter**: Headings, UI, most body text
- **Crimson Pro**: Long-form narrative (About page founder story)

### Verified Icons (These definitely work)
```
check-circle, user-group, heart, shield-check, chart-bar, 
arrow-trending-up, star, clock, cog, academic-cap, 
magnifying-glass, adjustments-horizontal, cube, document-text, 
rocket-launch, clipboard-document-check, briefcase, envelope
```

## üìû Calendly URLs (Copy Exact URLs)

**Routing Form (Primary)**:
```

```

git diff src/pages/[page].astro

# Stage and commit
git add src/pages/[page].astro
git commit -m "feat: add [page name] with [key features]"

# Example commits:
git commit -m "feat: add pricing page with three-tier structure and FAQ"
git commit -m "feat: add about page with founder story and mission"
git commit -m "feat: add contact page with embedded Calendly routing form"

# Push to development
git push origin development
```

### After All Three Pages Complete
```powershell
