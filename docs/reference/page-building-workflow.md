**Last Updated**: October 9, 2025  
**Version**: 2.0  
**Based On**: Successful October 2025 page implementations

---

## üéØ Goal: Build Quality Pages Efficiently

This workflow reflects **actual experience** from building the GaiaOps website pages (Homepage, 7 track pages, How We Help, Solutions overview). It uses the proven **hybrid Claude Desktop + Claude Code approach** that has delivered consistent results.

### Typical Page Timeline
- **Simple pages** (stub/basic): 2-4 hours
- **Medium complexity** (standard content): 4-6 hours  
- **Complex pages** (interactive/assessment): 6-10 hours

*These are realistic estimates, not aspirational targets.*

## üîÑ THE HYBRID WORKFLOW

### Overview: Four-Phase Approach

```
Phase 1: PLANNING (Claude Desktop)        ‚Üí Session plan document
Phase 2: IMPLEMENTATION (Claude Code)     ‚Üí Working code files
Phase 3: DEPLOYMENT (PowerShell/GitHub)   ‚Üí Live on dev/prod sites
Phase 4: REVIEW (Claude Desktop)          ‚Üí Documentation & learnings
```

---

## üìã PHASE 1: PLANNING & SETUP (Claude Desktop)

### Time: 30-45 minutes for new pages
### Tool: Claude.ai web interface (Desktop/Web Chat)

### Activities:

**1. Content Audit (10-15 min)**
- Review sitemap: What page are we building?
- Check existing pages: What patterns can we reuse?
- Identify required components: Which are already built?
- Review brand guidelines: Confirm colors, typography
- Check UTM structure: What Calendly links are needed?

**2. Session Plan Creation (15-20 min)**

Ask Claude Desktop to create a session plan that includes:

```markdown
# Session Plan: [Page Name]
**Date**: [Date]
**Estimated Time**: [Hours]

## Objective
[Clear description of what we're building]

## Page Structure
1. Hero Section
2. [Content sections...]
3. CTA Section

## Component Inventory
**Existing (Reuse):**
- Component name (location)

**New (Build):**
- Component name (requirements)

## Brand Requirements
- Colors: #2A7F7E (60%), #1B365D (30%), #D97642 (10%)
- Typography: Inter (UI), Crimson Pro (long-form)
- Spacing: 8px grid system

## Implementation Checklist

## üíª PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION (Claude Code)

### Time: 2-8 hours (varies by complexity)
### Tool: Claude Code extension in VS Code

### Setup:

**1. Start Dev Server (if not running)**
```powershell
npm run dev
```

**2. Verify Environment**
```powershell
# Check branch
git status

# If not on development:
git checkout development
git pull origin development
```

**3. Feed Context to Claude Code**

**CRITICAL FIRST MESSAGE:**
```
I'm working on [page name]. Here's the session plan:

[Paste or attach session plan from Claude Desktop]

Before we start coding, please:
1. Read docs/core/brand_guidelines_claude_code.md
2. Read docs/reference/heroicon-styling-guide.md (if using icons)

Let's start with Phase 1, Task 1: [specific task]
```

### Implementation Loop:

**For EACH section (repeat this cycle):**

**Step 1: Code Implementation**
- Claude Code reads relevant files
- Implements ONE section at a time
- Shows diff for your review
- You approve or request changes

**Step 2: IMMEDIATE Testing** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
```
1. Save file (Ctrl+S)
2. Switch to browser
3. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Check the new section:
   ‚úì Visual appearance correct?
   ‚úì Colors match brand (#2A7F7E, #1B365D, #D97642)?
   ‚úì Icons render properly (not giant shapes)?
   ‚úì Text readable and properly styled?
   ‚úì Spacing looks good?
5. Open DevTools Console (F12)
   ‚úì No errors?
   ‚úì No warnings?
6. Test responsive (resize browser)
   ‚úì Mobile layout works?
   ‚úì Tablet layout works?
   ‚úì Desktop layout works?
```

**Step 3: Fix Issues Immediately**
- If anything wrong, tell Claude Code BEFORE moving on
- Don't build next section until current one works
- Take screenshot for Claude Desktop review if needed

**Step 4: Commit After Working Section** *(Optional but recommended)*
```powershell
git add src/pages/[file].astro
git commit -m "feat: add [section name] to [page] - CU-[task-id]"
```

**Step 5: Repeat for Next Section**

### Common Implementation Patterns:

**Hero Section** (30-45 min)
- Large headline with brand positioning
- Subtitle with value proposition
- Primary + Secondary CTAs
- Background gradient or image
- Mobile responsive layout

**Content Section with Icons** (20-30 min)
- Grid layout (2-3 columns)
- Icon + heading + description cards
- **Remember**: Icons must use wrapper span with explicit sizing
```html
<span class="icon-teal"><Icon name="users" type="outline" /></span>
```

**Two-Column Layout** (25-35 min)
- Text content on left, visual on right (or vice versa)
- Proper responsive stack on mobile
- Balanced spacing

**CTA Section** (15-20 min)
- Clear call-to-action headline
- Primary + secondary buttons
- Calendly links with proper UTM parameters

### Tips for Efficient Implementation:

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Build sections in logical order (top to bottom)
- Test immediately after each section
- Copy patterns from existing pages
- Reference brand guidelines constantly
- Use exact hex codes (#2A7F7E, #1B365D, #D97642)

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Build multiple sections before testing
- Trust output without browser verification
- Type color codes from memory
- Skip responsive testing
- Forget `:global(svg)` for icons

### Output: Working page in local environment

## üöÄ PHASE 3: DEPLOYMENT (PowerShell + GitHub)

### Time: 10-15 minutes
### Tools: VS Code Terminal (PowerShell) + GitHub + Browser

### Step 1: Final Review
```powershell
# Check what changed
git status

# Review full diff
git diff src/pages/[page].astro

# Review specific sections if needed
git diff src/components/[component].astro
```

### Step 2: Stage & Commit
```powershell
# Stage all related changes
git add src/pages/[page].astro
git add src/components/[any-modified].astro
git add public/images/[any-new].png

# Commit with clear message
git commit -m "feat: complete [page name] page - CU-[task-id]

- Added hero section with brand positioning
- Implemented [section names]
- Mobile responsive design
- Brand guidelines compliance (60/30/10 colors)
- Calendly CTAs with UTM tracking"
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Development
```powershell
# Push to development branch
git push origin development
```

### Step 4: Test on Dev Site
```
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Sevalla auto-deploy
2. Visit: https://gaiaops-dev-f1kaz.sevalla.page/[page-path]
3. Full page testing:
   ‚úì All sections display
   ‚úì Navigation works
   ‚úì All CTAs clickable
   ‚úì Calendly links open correctly
   ‚úì Mobile responsive verified
   ‚úì No console errors
4. Test on actual mobile device (if available)
```

### Step 5: Deploy to Production (if approved)
```powershell
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest (safety check)
git pull origin main

# Merge development
git merge development

# Push to production
git push origin main

# Return to development
git checkout development
```

### Step 6: Verify Production
```
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for auto-deploy
2. Visit: https://gaiaops.io/[page-path]
3. Final smoke test:
   ‚úì Page loads correctly
   ‚úì No broken links
   ‚úì All features working
4. Clear browser cache and test again (hard refresh)
```

### Output: Page live on production site

1. **Reuse Aggressively**: Copy entire sections from similar pages and modify
2. **Component First**: Check existing components before building new ones
3. **Brand Reference Always Open**: Keep brand guidelines in separate tab
4. **Test Small**: Catch issues early by testing after every small change
5. **Screenshot Compare**: Compare new sections to existing pages visually

### Quality Improvements:

1. **Color Picker Verify**: Use browser DevTools to verify hex codes match
2. **Console Clean**: Always check browser console, fix warnings
3. **Real Device Test**: Test on actual phone/tablet when possible
4. **Accessibility Check**: Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA
5. **Performance Monitor**: Check Lighthouse scores periodically

### Time Management:

1. **Set Realistic Expectations**: Use proven estimates, not aspirations
2. **Take Breaks**: Fresh eyes catch issues faster
3. **One Section Focus**: Complete each fully before moving to next
4. **Document As You Go**: Update notes during work, not after
5. **Plan Tomorrow Today**: End session with clear next steps
